## Vehicle

- Show CarPlay arrows and the next-turn distance in the cluster's navigation view on head units built on the FCE/Coagent T7 platform, through their stock `fce_misc_service_hal_property` service, without ADB. Off by default: turn on **Guidance in the FCE cluster (experimental)** in the **Navigation on HUD and dashboard** card, which now also appears on these head units. See [BYD navigation](BYD_NAVIGATION.md#cluster-guidance-on-fce-head-units-needs-no-adb). The property path was confirmed in a car with Android Auto guidance; this CarPlay integration has not yet run in a car.
